We provide several scripts that you can use to help prepare, manage and use GUT data.  These have been developed by users.  If you have any improvements or your own scripts that could be of use to the community to share please contact us and we can link to them here.

#RTools

â€‹	*GU_Summary Toolkit*:  Plots maps and summarizes unit geometries and site characteristics.

#ArcPy Tools

 	*SmoothPolygon.py*:  will smooth your output polygon edges

## polygonMetrics.py

*polygonMetrics.py*: Computes different metrics for output geometries

## mappingtool.py

Imports and symbolized GUT output into existing ArcMap.  This will need to be updated to reflect the most current version of GUT output.  It probably won't work at first.

## CHAMP_gdbExport.py

Extracts the necessary GUT import files from batch CHaMP geodatabase and puts them into a GUT inputs folder with the correct names, etc.  This script is old and hasn't been updated in a while.  It will need to be updated  to work correctly.
