### Unit Shape

- **Convexity**
- **Planar**
- **Concavity**

### Unit Form
- **Mound** - High residual topography, generally convex streamwise and transverse.
- **Mound Transition** - High residual topography transitioning to plane
- **Saddle** - Generally convex in the streamwise direction but planar transverse to stream. The user can choose to not include this form.
- **Wall** - High residal topography that is steep and planar
- **Plane** - Flat (i.e., neither convex nor concave)
- **Trough** - Generally concave transverse  but planar in the streamwise direction.
- **Bowl Transition** - Concave streamwise and transverse but relatively shallower and transitioning to trough
- **Bowl** - Low residual topography Concave transverse and streamwise
